# GuessingGame
Guessing Game – Daily Grade
This program plays a guessing game where the computer picks a random number and asks the player to try to guess it. Let the player keep guessing, but tell them if their guess is too low or too high. When they get it right, tell them they win!

Grading

20 Points: The computer can pick a random number and tells the player to try and guess it!

20 Points: The player must guess until they get it correct!
Use one while loop for this!

20 Points: If their guess is too low or too high, tell them!
Use if-statements for this!

20 Points: When the player’s guess is the same as the answer, tell them they win and let the program end!

20 Points: Before ending the program, tell the player how many tries it took them!

Bonus 10 Points: Ask the player if they want to play again after winning. If they do, pick a new random number, reset the number of tries to zero, and play the game again. 
If they choose not to play again, tell them “Thanks for playing!” and then let the program end.
